## What is Simon Says

Simon Says is a short-term memory skill game. There are four buttons that produce their own color and sound. A round consist of repeating the computer's random sequence in the correct order. As the game progresses, so does the difficulty.


<br />

## How to Play

1. Press the `START` button.
2. The `COMPUTER` will play the color sequence.
3. On `PLAYER` turn, choose the colors in the correct sequence.
4. If correct, the `COMPUTER` will play the next sequence.
5. `PLAYER` will lose once the inputted sequence is not correct
6. To play again, hit the `RESTART` button.

### About This Project
Written for **General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp**

The thought process behind this game is to emulate the Hasbro Simon Game. It has the game pad and reactive, light up buttons with sound.

This is my first project utilizing JS and manipulating the DOM. One challenging aspect was having the glow effect added to the game pad without clipping other elements.
